The happy news is we have found the bug and took necessary actions to correct it.
We are going to delete such downloads from our system by 4.00 pm, 3rd of April 2007. Therefore those who have faced this problem please try downloading them again.

If you are facing any problem in downloading a file, please send an email to noc@cmb.ac.lk with file URL. Thank you.
